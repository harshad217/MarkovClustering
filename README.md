# MarkovClustering

<h3> The program performs markov clustering on various Networks </h3>

***

<h5> The Networks include AT&T Network graph, Physics researchers and their collaborations with other researchers graph & Yeast metabolic network graph. </h5>

<h6> Program extracts the given node-to-node mappings and builds an adjacency matrix. The adj matrix is normalized to get a transition matrix, and MCL is implemented till the resultant transition matrix converges to a steady state. The clusters formed are visualized using pajek.
